## Getting Started

To get a local copy of ShopEase up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* MongoDB database (local installation or cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nnneh/ShopEase.git](https://github.com/nnneh/ShopEase.git)
    cd ShopEase
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.
    * Add necessary environment variables for your database connection and JWT secret:
        ```env
        MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
        ```
    * Create a `.env.local` file in the `client` directory (for Next.js specific env vars).
    * Add your backend API URL:
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
        ```

5.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  **Start the frontend application:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
